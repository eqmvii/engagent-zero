Now we're going to build a simple blog. 

Here is a sample image for design inspiration.

Please build a mock toolbar at the top, a mock title for the blog post, and a mock byline. Then add some lorem ipsum text for the blog post underneath.

Do not worry about a comments section - we will add that later. Use placeholders for images. The menu does not need to function.

Update json/users.json to include 4 users, each with a boring name. Include register date and dummy email address for each.

Now update json/comments.json to contain 3 short comments, and ensure each is authored by a different user from json/users.json
