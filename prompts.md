Now we're going to build a simple blog. 

Here is a sample image for design inspiration.

Please build a mock toolbar at the top, a mock title for the blog post, and a mock byline. Then add some lorem ipsum text for the blog post underneath.

Do not worry about a comments section - we will add that later. Use placeholders for images. The menu does not need to function.

---

Update json/users.json to include 4 users, each with a boring name. Include register date and dummy email address for each.

---

Now update json/comments.json to contain 3 short comments, and ensure each is authored by a different user from json/users.json

---

Now please build a comments section. Add it where the comment is in App.vue.

It should read json/comments.json to know the content of each comment. Each should include the user and their dummy avatar in a byline. 

The comments section is not nested, it's just a list top to bottom.

Each comment should have a placeholder reaction button, a placeholder reply button, and a placeholder AI Assist button

---

I found the issue. On GitHub pages, the JSON is in a subdirectory like this: https://eqmvii.github.io/engagent-zero/json/users.json

So after we build the files, we need to update all of the JSON references to prepend /engagent-zero/

---

above prompt did not work. Need to find issue manually and give more clear directions.

---

Edit the deploy.sh script to read all .html and .js files in the docs/ and docs/assets folders and edit them as follows:

1. delete the leading slash before any instance of /assets/
2. delete the leading slash before any instance of /json/

Add a comment explaining this is so the path works on github pages where the repo name is a folder after the main URL.

FYI the script will exclusively run in a node-alpine docker container

Above prompt got good output with SWE-1-lite but was a horrible loop on SWE-1 (free limited), odd? Starting to experience the "model A works well, model B doesn't" phenom. Having choices may help?

---

lite: 

When a user clicks reply on a comment, it should open a comment box underneath.

It should have a submit button and an "AI suggest" button. Neither should so anything, this is just a mock.

---

SWE-1:

The reply box is unstyled and too narrow. Please apply styles to make it look modern and inline with the rest of the app. I've attached a picture of what it currently looks like.

---

Total fail, did all kinds of random shit including adding emojis I didn't want?

---

lite:

Give the textarea a width of 100%

Add a few pixels of padding under the comment-content div and before the text area

"write your reply" inside the text area has no padding between it and the top/left of the comment box. Make it pretty OR ELSE.

---

lite:

Change the AI Assit and AI Suggest buttons to be red in a way that implies they are admin-only tools

Make the red styling on the admin only buttons a little more subtle 

Replace the "featured image" text at the top of app.vue with an actual placeholder featured image, much like the content image in the middle

---


We need another modal window. When the user clicks the "AI Suggest" button, open a model on the RIGHT hand side of the window, exactly like the "AI Assist" modal - just on the right side. For now, no content should appear within it, just "AI Assist" at the top.

---

both modals work but open in the middle of the page lol. Whatever, AI does whatever it wants!

---

Make the AI Suggest modal populate with the JSON content in suggest-summary

---

Having real issues here - it isn't pulling data in.

---

Make it so that the ai suggest modal pulls ai-suggest-comment data from the comments json to populate the modal, the same way the assist modal pulls assist-summary. 

---

May have been vibing too hard, and accidentally updated the wrong JSON file (docs instead of root) and so of course AI was doing the right thing and I had the setup wrong. 

AI 1, Eric 0.

---

lite:

When opening either modal, display a loading spinner and the text "sending historical user data to Gemini for processing..." for 5 seconds.

This is a mockup, so we don't need a loading spinner - the 5 seconds will have to be hardcoded in - but it will make the experience closer to what we hope the real thing will be.

---

That got it in a "I'll try a different approach" loop for a while but the result was EXCELLENT.
