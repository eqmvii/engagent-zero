Now we're going to build a simple blog. 

Here is a sample image for design inspiration.

Please build a mock toolbar at the top, a mock title for the blog post, and a mock byline. Then add some lorem ipsum text for the blog post underneath.

Do not worry about a comments section - we will add that later. Use placeholders for images. The menu does not need to function.
